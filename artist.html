                design” he said once in an interview by The New Times 2021.

        <h2>Artist <span>Statement</span> </h2>
        <div><p class="about-txt">As a mixed media artist, I draw inspiration from the vibrant tapestry of everyday 
            life and the breathtaking landscapes of Rwanda. My artistic journey began at 
            a young age in nursery school, Later it grew as i joined nyundo art school, 
            where I honed a diversity of techniques, 
            particularly in ballpoint pen. I believe that mistakes in art can transform 
            into powerful designs, a philosophy that has shaped my creative process.
            
            
            Throughout my career, I've participated in various art competitions, 
            including the Rwanda Transparency Art Competition and Art Rwanda Ubuhanzi, 
            allowing me to share my work on both local and international stages. 
            My exhibitions in countries such as Belgium, France, and the USA have 
            provided platforms to engage with diverse audiences and contribute to 
            global art dialogues.
            
            My art serves as a tribute to Rwanda’s rich heritage 
            and hardworking people. Each piece tells a story, capturing the essence of 
            Rwandan society and celebrating its beauty. Collaborating with NGOs like 
            UNHCR and UNESCO has further deepened my commitment to using art as a means 
            of connection and reflection.
            
            I strive to create work that resonates with 
            viewers, fostering a deeper appreciation for our shared human experiences 
            and the cultural nuances that define us. Through my vibrant and thought-provoking 
            pieces, I aim to bridge cultural boundaries and inspire others to see the world 
            through a lens of creativity and understanding.</p>
